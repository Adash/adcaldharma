  `The nature of everything is illusory and ephemeral,
  Those with dualistic perception regard suffering as happiness,
  Like they who lick the honey from a razor’s edge.
  How pitiful are they who cling strongly to concrete reality:
  Turn your attention within, my heart friends.`,
  `What we understand to be phenomena
  Are but the magical projections of the mind.
  The hollow vastness of the sky
  I never saw to be afraid of anything.
  All this is but the self-glowing light of clarity.
  There is no other cause at all.`,
  `Theoretical knowledge has no end. Take to heart and practice what you have learned.`,
  `Nothing is steady, nothing lasts.
  The only thing that is reliable is Dharma practice.`,
  `Don’t dwell in the past or anticipate the future. Regardless of whatever appears to the six consciousnesses, do not be attached, allow things to pass.`,
  `Looking outwards brings perpetual delusion.
  But look within and you’ll see your own mind.`,
  `Once you overcome the hatred within your mind, you will discover that in the world outside, there is no longer any such thing as even a single enemy.`,
  `If we lack peace of mind, then what good does it do us to have youth, beauty, health, wealth, education, and worldly power?`,
  `The more you are preoccupied by your own physical aging, the more anxious you will become. Do not worry so much about your physical appearance. Concentrate, rather, on not wasting your life. Practice the Dharma. The more you engage in it, the more your satisfaction will grow.`,
  `Whatever attainment that we may want in this life, the only thing that really counts is what we do in this present moment.`,
  `Can consciousness exist without being conscious of anything? Consciousness cannot exist without Joy.`,
  `We are trying to hold on to and collect pleasant, blissful meditation experiences because we are afraid that we will loose them. If the real experience comes it is beyond loosing, it will be fully part of me.`,
  `There is no better sign of accomplishment than a disciplined mind. This is true victory for the real warrior who carries no weapons.`,
  `The extent of your realization will be known when you encounter difficult circumstances. You will not know the extent of your realization when things go well.`,
  `Let yourself become that space that welcomes any experience without judgement.`,
  `Don't talk too much about practice. Just do it. "I think I should meditate more.” No. Don't think like this. Just sit down and meditate.`,
  `For as long as space endures, for as long as sentient beings remain, until then may I too remain to dispel the miseries of the world.`,
  `The essence of the highest teachings lies within a simple moment of awareness.`,
  `It does not matter how many possessions you own. The more content you are, the richer you will become inside. A king could feel like the poorest, and the poorest could feel like a king.`,
  `Everything is unreal which means that we can't find anything but we can experience everything.`,
  `"Name the colours, blind the eye" is an old Zen saying, illustrating that the intellect's habitual ways of branding and labelling creates a terrible experiential loss by displacing the vibrant, living reality with a steady stream of labels.`,
  `Our suffering seems to occur because of the object of our desire or aversion, but that's not really so. It happens because the mind splits into object-subject duality and becomes involved in wanting or not wanting something.`,
  `Do not encumber your mind with useless thoughts. What good is it to brood over the past and fret about the future? Dwell in the simplicity of the present moment. Live in harmony with the dharma. Make it the heart of your life and experience. Be the master of your own destiny.`,
  `The moment we become aware that everything arises from within the mind itself, our attachment to the idea of an objective world that exists separately from us dissolves. Through this insight we become free and cease to suffer`,
